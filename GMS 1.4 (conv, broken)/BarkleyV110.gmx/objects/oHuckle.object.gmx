It's not because I'm afraid they'll dislike me or think I'm a freak or anything, it's that I just can't pinpoint an answer. I mean, yeah, the sexual attraction was always there, but I don't think that's really it. My dad was an alcoholic. He was never really there, he was always wasting his time and money at the bar. Before he left for the bar, he would always tell me, "+'"You stay there and watch that TV and if '+"you're not there when I get back*.*.*. well boy, there'll"+' be hell to pay,"'+". So I watched the TV. My favorite show was Huckleberry Hound. I just loved that dog; the way he talked, the way he sang and dance. It was great. I*.*.*. I guess I looked at Huckleberry Hound as the father I never had. I mean, he taught me how to ride a bike, he taught me how to swim, he taught me everything. But I didn't just want to be LIKE Huckleberry Hound, I wanted to BE him.** Well, here I am, Huckleberry Hound. This is me, this is who I was born to be.");
