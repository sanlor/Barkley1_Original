Once we became aware of the evils of sugar, it would be tantamount to sin to keep this information secret. Thus we formed a group of the most devout L.I.B.E.R.T.Y. followers to travel the lands spreading the word. We called them the Needles of Hope. After a year of their successful campaign to liberate the world of sugar, something sinister occurred.

What we didn't know was that sugar was sentient... Living, if you will, be it a very basic existence. Its ultimate goal was to control humanity through diabetes, acting as a parasite to force its will upon the unsuspecting populace. Once we set the wheels in motion to stop it... It evolved.

I am actually quite shocked the connection between sugar and delmons was never made given the obvious traits.",1);

So the Sugar Delmons knew their days were outnumbered, and as a last ditch effort to combat our aggressive war against them, they all convened at the Tower of Glucose. Otherwise known as the former Domino Sugar factory, its destruction during the cyberpocalypse lead to a great pillar of sugar being created.
