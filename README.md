# Barkley1_Original
The decompiled source code for Barkley, Shut Up And Jam: Gaiden

This is mostly for my own curiosity.
I needed to ~~steal~~ reference some code and formula for the combat system for another project.

## Tools
This game was made using GameMaker 6.1, you can find it here: https://archive.org/details/gamemaker1-6  
GM 6.1 does not run on modern OSs. Either run Windows XP on a VM or patch GM 6.1 using this: https://github.com/LiEnby/GM6Vista  
The source code was decompiled using this tool: https://gamebanana.com/tools/13057  
  
Additionally, I converted the source code to work on the GM 8.1 and GMS 1.4 editor, since working on GM 6.1 is a pain. The game doesn't compile, but I'm only interested on the code, not the game itself.  

## Optional
Leave this playing on repeat on another tab: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWKQiZVBtu4
