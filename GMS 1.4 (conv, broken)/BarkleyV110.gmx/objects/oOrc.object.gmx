While all of us endorse and encourage nonviolent methods of dealing with conflicts, there are many above ground who do not share our views. Every few months we'll get a raid from the surface. Usually they don't cause too much trouble. A few rocks or bottles thrown, and maybe a few of us will go to bed with bruises. Every once in a while however, their hatred will be too great, their attacks too violent. On more than one occasion these weapons you see have saved our lives. It's regrettable that we must use them, and clearly against our principles. But to save the life of one of my brothers our sisters here in the sewers... to save the life of one of my comrades? If it comes to that, I'd gladly give up those principles. It pains me to think that I might ever have to hurt any living being, but everyone here is family to me. I would do anything to protect them, even if it meant taking up arms. In the meantime though... I suppose I'll just pray it never comes to that.");
