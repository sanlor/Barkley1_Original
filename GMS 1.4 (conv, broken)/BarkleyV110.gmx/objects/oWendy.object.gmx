Some of us might have been running from the law, others because they just didn't fit in up there. It doesn't matter why we're here, what matters is that we're outcasts and none of us can ever go back up. They say there's a doctor up there who can help people to look however they want, but could he help a person like me? My hands, my feet... they're basketballs. We came down here because of shame. If we went back up, it'd only be worse.");

That's what they did with the Purge, it was their way of saying we don't want you if you can dribble a basketball. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a basketball player but it was only a matter of time before they did it again with some other group. I wasn't going to let that happen to me. I wasn't going to get killed because I didn't fit the status quo... It's kind of sad, though, what I've become. I don't know what's going on up there anymore but I have to wonder if I made the right choice. I don't think dying would be so bad after all.");
