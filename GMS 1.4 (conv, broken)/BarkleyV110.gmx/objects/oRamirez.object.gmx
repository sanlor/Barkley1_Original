Let's get started on the basics. That's the hunter quest bulletin board. It shows all the hunter quests that are currently available to you. Hunter quests are jobs or missions you can accept that require you to perform a task for someone, usually hunting down a monster. You got that?");

The bright ones are the ones that always think they know everything and do something stupid and I don't want to see that happen to you. You can see more information on a specific hunt by selecting it. You can gauge your hunt's difficult by its monster grade, which can range from E - weak to S - strong. I'd start with rank E monsters and work your way up if were you.");
