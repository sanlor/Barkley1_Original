The steep incline upwards, the slight curvature to the right, the deep emerald hue... I've almost got it, but not quite. Just one more surgery. You know, it's almost ironic. I'm undergoing treatment to make my hair look like a vidcon hero, and yet I financed my surgery by auctioning off a good portion of my vintage game collection. In fact, one could posit that for the most part, the path my life takes is determined by vidcons, and by vidcons alone... it's a difficult path, but one I shall shall always walk.");
