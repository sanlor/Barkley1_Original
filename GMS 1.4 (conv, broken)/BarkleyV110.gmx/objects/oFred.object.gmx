You see, I was skulking about the woods when I heard the buzzing of bees above me. As I am fond, perhaps even overly fond, of the taste of honey, I began to climb the tree. Imagine my surprise when I found out that a pygmy had already beaten me to the precious honey! Why, I was downright ticked so I gathered up all my gumption and hit him in the liver with a magical warhammer inscribed with arcane runes of power. And hohoho, I never knew a pygmy could fly, but he sure did! Well, until he hit the ground! A little Duergar humor! Ahh, but I haven't murdered a pygmy in years...",0);

One night I got the idea to put the bear traps to use, so I broke into a retirement home, placed the bear traps in strategic locations, and hid outside in the bushes until the morning. You should have heard the endless clacka-lacking of those metal contraptions snapping on the legs of the elderly, much like the ferocious maw of an enraged hell hound. And I sure got a stern talking-to by the blacksmith, but it sure was worth it!",0);
