            <string>mn[0]="Duergar";
md[0]="Duergars are evil, black dwarfs that live primarily in underground caverns, where they mine arduously for rubies and gemstones. Their foremost focus is rubies, for which they toil endlessly so as to further the agenda of their ghastly duergar gods. They battle constantly with other subterranean menaces and are highly skilled with double-handed adamantium weaponry.";
mn[1]="Sludge Elf";
md[1]="Unlike their forest-dwelling High Elven cousins, Sludge Elves prefer to live in the swamp so as to maintain a proximity to their primary form of sustenance: tar. The eschew the use of magic and weaponry in combat, instead preferring the more primal feeling of unarmed fighting. Most Sludge Elves adopt the path of transmuter, where they harness the dangerous powers of alchemy and bubbling brews.";
mn[2]="Drider";
md[2]="Driders are the asexual, subterranean offspring of Dark Elves (or Drow) and spiders, cursed to forever wander labyrinthine underground caves in search of foes to menace. Most driders are incapable of communication and are thought to be functionally retarded, although this does not diminish their capabilities to dual wield exotic weaponry.";
mn[3]="Ghast";
md[3]="Ghasts are the reanimated undead corpses of Hill Dwarfs. They are believed to be insentient by most leading ghast experts and their only known motive in their undeath is to gorge on dwarf brains and flesh. Their incredibly thick skin makes them resistant to all ice-based wizardry although they are more susceptible to nunchucks.";
mn[4]="Bugbear";
md[4]="Bugbears are large, goblinized boogeymen that reside within dank donjons and lust endlessly for treasure and goblets. They live alone, rather than in packs or in a society, because they become too covetous of treasure. Regardless of this, many bugbears enjoy playing pranks, especially if the pranks are somehow related to glittering goblets.";
mn[5]="Doppleganger";
md[5]="Doppelgangers are shadowy and enigmatic monstrous humanoids capable of changing shape, usually to gulp the blood of those around them. Although they are not vampires, they have vampiric tendencies and it is often speculated that doppelgangers are a sub-type of oni. They are capable of casting a level 3 Bigby's Groping Hand twice a day.";
mn[6]="Blue Dragonkin";
md[6]="As their name implies, Blue Dragonkin are reptilian humanoids covered in a dense armor of blue scales. In Dragonkin society, they most often take the role of magician, energizing their dragon allies with powerful wizard zaps. They are known for being accomplished mages and practice an advanced form of arcane thaumaturgy that bedazzles all foes combined.";
mn[7]="Red Dragonkin";
md[7]="Red Dragonkin are covered in two layers of scales, which makes them more resistant to the ferocious bludgeoning of morning stars (and other like instruments of warfare). They represent the warrior caste of Dragonkin society and train daily in dojos all across the globe. In addition, they have a saving throw to all duergars.";
mn[8]="Gold Dragonkin";
md[8]="Though it is speculated that Gold Dragonkin were originally spawned from a blood temple in Hell, they are in fact related to the other Dragonkin. They are known for being the assassins of Dragonkin society, as well as their virulent racism towards hobgoblins and other members of the goblinoid genus. The gold coloring of their scales reflects all incoming boomerangs and Melf's Acid Arrows. They are skilled in all forms of acrobatics.";
