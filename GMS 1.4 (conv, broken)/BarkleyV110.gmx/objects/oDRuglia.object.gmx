Preferably she'd like to wear stuff I pick out for her and she'd be just as willing to do any random little chore or apeasment that I already dedicate so much of my convenience to others for(and her included of course). \+Big bonus points if she likes my creativity and RPGMaker game(s/coding skill)\+Someone who could act almost as my double, going anywhere I went, but who needed my help for things. Lifting something, inturpreting more complex Japanese, explaining things clearly, mathematical calculations...\+My first kid will be a girl named Terra or a boy named Ryukaze. Hopefully this wouldn't need discussion(Though I might think harder about "+'"Ryukaze"'+"...).\+I could explain some other 100% necessary no-exception-for-anything details, but those are more "+'"personal"'+"...\+One admitable detail for my last point is she'd need to like roleplaying, pretending, make-believe etc. because two things I like in private are flattery (and flattering) and "+'"foreplay"'+".");
