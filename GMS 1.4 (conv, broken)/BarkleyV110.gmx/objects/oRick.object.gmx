That all changes once you start living down here, once you start sucking in those b-ball energies. It's everywhere. It's in the air, it's in the ground, it's in the food, it's in the walls. You can't avoid it no matter what you do. It'll get you as long as you're down here and when it does, you start to change. Maybe your hair will get thin and wirey like a net, or maybe you'll grow a b-ball tumor or maybe your hands will turn into whistles. It's different for everyone, but one thing's for sure: as long as you're down here it'll get you.");

I don't know why you'd want to do that for a bunch of freaks like us, but it's a real kind gesture. We don't usually get visitors and when we do, they're not the good kind. It's hard to believe that people can be motivated by more than just greed these days, especially down here.");
